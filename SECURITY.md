# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The following table shows which of NekoSauce's versions are receiving security updates. We'll usually only release security updates for the lastest version, but it may happen that more of them get these if we decide (probably won't happen) to release a LTS version.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you've found a security issue, you can send an email to [security@nekosauce.org](mailto:security@nekosauce.org) with a detailed description about the issue. DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE OR POST ABOUT IT ANYWHERE ELSE.

We'll notify you about whether your report was accepted or not after we review it. In case that it is accepted, we'll start working on it as soon as possible to release a patch.
